            <h3>Sharks</h3>
            <p>
              Want to swim with sharks? This trip is for you. We will see tiger
              sharks, hammerheads, lemons and occasionally whale sharks. Not
              only will you have a thrill experiencing silent, graceful beauties
              swim right by you.

            <h3>Coral Restoration</h3>
            <p>
              Learn about coral re-growth and restoration. On this trip you will
              work with a team of coral specialists. You'll see how they grow
              and care for the coral polyps, and once they are large enough, how
              each one is meticulously attached to the reef.

            Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love ocean. After going on
            one of these tours, I can safely say that they are my favorite
            geographic feature, and I would like to visit again whenever I get a
            chance.
